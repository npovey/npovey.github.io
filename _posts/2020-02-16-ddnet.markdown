**A Sparse-View CT Reconstruction Method Based on Combination of DenseNet and Deconvolution.**

The plan is to try the DD-Net on our sparse-view data.

*What is deconvolution?*

Convolution is when we take the image and try to shrink it. Deconvolution is basically the same as a convolution layer, except instead of subsampling we do upsampling and the 'stride' is interpreted oppositely. So stride=2 would do upsampling by 2 (output has twice more things) instead of downsampling by 2. Example below is for deconvolution in python.

```python
u6 = Conv2DTranspose(64, (2, 2), strides=(2, 2), padding='same') (c51)
```
