My current interests are Cloud Computing, Networking and Distributed Systems.
Past few months I was working with AWS, Azure, RESTful APIs and Web Apps.
Also, I am working on my research project on improving the quality of low dose and sparse-view CT Scans.
The project is implemented using the Keras functional API with the TensorFlow backend.
